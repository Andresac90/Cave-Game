# Game Concept

The Cave is a first-person horror game, this game puts the player in the role of a cave diver that got lost during an expedition.

# Main Mechanics

The player needs to escape the cave, utilizing different equipment and parkour, while being chased by an evil entity.

## Flashlight

The player has a flashlight that has a fixed amount of battery, while escaping the cave he needs to collect batteries to keep his flashlight on. If the flashlight goes off, he needs to move in the level utilizing sound guidance and it gets much harder until he finds more batteries again.

## Rope

The player can use ropes to climb up and to pass between ravines/holes.

## Cave diving sections

There are sections where the space is very limited, and the player needs to enter a cave diving mini-game to pass the zone.

## More to come

For now, these 4 mechanics will be present in the first iterations of the game.

# Level Design

Still not decided about the level design, I have two possibilities for now:

1. Rogue-like level design, the levels are procedurally generated and each “run” is different.
2. Fixed-level design, the level is created and crafted “by hand”.

With the first iterations of the game in Unity I will decide which approach to take.

# Controls
WASD Move

# Known Issues
Flashlight battery isnt working.
